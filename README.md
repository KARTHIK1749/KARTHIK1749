# Hi, I'm Karthik Panuganti 👋

🚀 Builder | AI & ML Enthusiast | Open-Source Contributor

🎯 Focused on **LLM-powered applications, AI-assisted design systems, and real-world problem solving**

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a student developer who loves **building from scratch and understanding systems deeply** rather than just plugging libraries together.

I work at the intersection of:

- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**
- **LLM applications (RAG, agents, embeddings)**
- **AI-assisted creative & developer tools**

Currently exploring how **AI can act as a co-pilot** instead of a black box — especially in design, developer productivity, and decision-making systems.
